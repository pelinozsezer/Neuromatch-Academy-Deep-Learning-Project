# **Brain Tumor Segmentation Using U-Net Model on BraTS Dataset**

We employed a 2D U-Net model to segment brain tumors using the BraTS (Brain Tumor Segmentation) dataset. The preprocessed dataset includes 2D MRI scans and tumor masks from 484 participants, each containing post-contrast T1-weighted (T1Gd), T2-weighted, and T2-FLAIR volumes, with expert-segmented masks for enhancing tumor, peritumoral edema, and necrotic/non-enhancing tumor core. Our methodology leverages the multi-modal nature of the dataset to improve the U-Net model’s accuracy in segmenting tumor regions. Data preprocessing involved several steps: splitting the dataset into training, validation, and test sets; cropping blank pixels along the edges to reduce dimensions; normalizing data; and tumor labels’ binarization by combining edema, enhancing, and non-enhancing tumor labels into a single label. We tested the U-Net model on subsets of the training and validation data (500 slices each) using various loss functions, including BCE, IOU, Dice, and Focal loss. We found that the Dice loss function demonstrated the most stable loss curve and achieved the best accuracy, IOU, and F1 score on the validation set. This project demonstrates the effectiveness of the U-Net model in medical imaging for tumor detection. Future work should focus on enhancing model robustness, such as using a 3D U-Net, exploring additional MRI modalities to improve segmentation accuracy further, and segmenting multi-labeled tumors to increase medical usefulness.
